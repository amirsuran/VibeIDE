# release-windows.ps1 — Local Windows build + GitHub Release
#
# TWO-PHASE FLOW (default working mode — build & test first, publish the SAME build after):
#   Phase 1 — bump + compile + package, NO publish (carry the archive / test from the folder):
#     .\scripts\release-windows.ps1 -Version vX.Y.Z -SkipPublish
#   Phase 2 — publish the SAME tested artifacts WITHOUT recompiling (fast):
#     .\scripts\release-windows.ps1 -SkipCompile
#   A version stamp written into out-build during Phase 1 is verified in Phase 2, so a
#   prebuilt publish can only ship the exact version it was compiled at (no stale code).
#   If Phase-1 testing fails: fix code → re-run Phase 1 with the next -Version → retest.
#
# Other usage:
#   .\scripts\release-windows.ps1                  # one-shot: auto-bump patch + compile + publish
#   .\scripts\release-windows.ps1 -Version v0.2.0  # override version (one-shot publish)
#   .\scripts\release-windows.ps1 -SkipCompile     # publish prebuilt at current product.json version
#                                                  # (stamp must match out-build, else refused)
#   .\scripts\release-windows.ps1 -Draft           # create release as draft
#   .\scripts\release-windows.ps1 -SkipPublish     # build + package artifacts only (no tag/publish)
# Requires: Node.js, gh CLI (winget install GitHub.cli), InnoSetup (choco install innosetup)

# ── Release integrity: never PUBLISH stale code ───────────────────────────────
# A published release MUST correspond to artifacts compiled-from-source at THIS exact
# version. Two ways to satisfy that:
#   • recompile in this run (default), OR
#   • -SkipCompile publish of a build whose `out-build/.vibe-build-version` stamp matches
#     product.json — i.e. it WAS compiled at this same version in a prior Phase-1 build
#     (`-Version vX.Y.Z -SkipPublish`). This is the two-phase flow: bump+compile+test first,
#     then publish the SAME tested artifacts without re-compiling.
# The stamp check in the freshness section below ENFORCES this and is what prevents the
# "new version label on stale code" class ("0.14.0 ran 0.13.31"). A -SkipCompile publish
# with a missing/mismatched stamp is refused there, so no early hard-block is needed.
# Captured before any compile so the freshness guard (after compile) can assert the
# compiled output was actually (re)written during THIS run.
