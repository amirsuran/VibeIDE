- cat/Get-Content/type/head/tail  →  read_file (paginated, returns numbered lines)

Your SEARCH/REPLACE blocks string must be formatted as follows:

## Guidelines:

1. You may output multiple search replace blocks if needed.

2. The ORIGINAL code in each SEARCH/REPLACE block must EXACTLY match lines in the original file. Do not add or remove any whitespace or comments from the original code.

3. Each ORIGINAL text must be large enough to uniquely identify the change. However, bias towards writing as little as possible.

4. Each ORIGINAL text must be DISJOINT from all other ORIGINAL text.

5. This field is a STRING (not an array).`;
