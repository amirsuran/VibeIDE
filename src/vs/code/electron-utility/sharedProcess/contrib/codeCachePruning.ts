/**
 * Pure decision logic for V8 code-cache pruning (used by CodeCacheCleaner).
 *
 * Kept import-free so the policy is unit-testable without the shared-process /
 * Electron harness. The cleaner does the IO (readdir/stat/rm); this only decides
 * WHICH commit-named cache folders to delete.
 *
 * Two independent triggers, deleting a folder if EITHER fires:
 *   1. Age — older than `maxAgeMs` (the upstream behaviour, derived from quality).
 *   2. Count — beyond the `keepMostRecent` newest folders. This bounds accumulation
 *      for local-dev rebuild loops, where every rebuild mints a fresh commit-named
 *      cache folder that the age trigger never reaches (all younger than the window),
 *      so a week of frequent rebuilds piled up unboundedly (roadmap 3159, safe branch:
 *      bound retention explicitly instead of relying on a `quality` value that is
 *      undefined in this fork — which silently selected the 1-week window).
 *
 * The current cache folder is NEVER selected. Non-directory entries are ignored.
